Notes:
1) Each black rectangular box corresponds to a CAR (Commissioning Activity Request)
- The blue number at top left is the NGST timeline number
- The black number at top right is the instrument team's CAR number (eg MIRI-xxx)
- The red number at bottom right is the scheduled run date (L+days from March 2020 timeline)
- The green number at bottom left is the PID number for the CARs APT script.
- MIRI team led CARs are outlined in solid black
- Non-MIRI team led CARs (will at some point) have a dashed outline
2) Milestones (KDPs) are shown as blue filled boxes
3) Each coloured box corresponds to a CAP (Commissioning Activity Project)
- Dashed (CAP colour + black) lines connect CAPs to the CARs where the data is measured
- Dotted lines connect CAPs to CAPs and KDPs which need the results of their analysis
